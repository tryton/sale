Getting sales data
==================

You can analyse aggregated sales data using the items found under the
[:menuselection:`Sales --> Reporting`] main menu item.
These `Sales Reports <concept-sale.reporting>` allow you to view sales
grouped by a range of different factors.

.. note::

   The value of the sales in these reports are always shown in the
   `Company's <company:model-company.company>`
   `Currency <currency:model-currency.currency>`.

   To ensure the values that are shown are correct you must ensure that you
   have correctly `set the currency exchange rates
   <currency:Setting currency exchange rates>` for any currencies that you
   use, including for the company's currency.
